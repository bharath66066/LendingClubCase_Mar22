## General Information
- General Information about the project
  To Get an idea how real world problems are solved using Exploratory Data Analysis, the case study of Lending Club, a consumer Finance Company is taken up.
  
- Background of the project.
  The Loan data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
  
- Business Problem that is being solved:
  - To understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
  - To understand the driving factors/variables behind a loan default.
  - To Improve portfolio and risk assessment tools, identification of the risky loan applicants, will help in reducing such loans, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

- Dataset used:
  - It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011. 
  - For the Loan rejected applications, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company 

## Conclusions
> In Conclusion, there is a high chance of defaulting  when the following apply loan:
- People with Grade 'B' apply.
- Applications with tenure of '36 months‘ 
- Applicants who took loan for 'debt_consolidation'.
- People having house_ownership as 'RENT‘
- Applications submitted in the month of December and November.
- Employees with '<1 year experience
- Applicants having annual income between 70-80k and interest rate at 21-24%
- Applicants whose obtained loans for small business and the loan amount in between 14-16k.

> Suggestion:
- The strong indicators of default are listed above. We suggest the Lending Club to utilize this analysis to assess and mitigate the risks and there by cutting down the overall credit loss.
